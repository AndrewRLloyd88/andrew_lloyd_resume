<h1 id="sec:summary">Summary</h1>
<p>From an early age I was introduced to computers by my brother in law, and ever since I have always had a fascination with software development coupled with a curiosity about building things and problem solving. Working in the film industry and as a lecturer formerly, programming was a hobby that kept on drawing me back in. This year I was laid off from my role as an office administrator, which spurred me on to go back to school and pursue my dream of web development. Not only have do I find coding intellectually stimulating but I have quickly realised that I am now doing what I love. Since starting Lighthouse Labs’ 12 week bootcamp I have read through more material than I thought humanly possible to, taken extra Udemy courses on parallel to my studies, and created a portfolio of applications. Working as a full stack developer has been a transformative, rewarding and fulfilling experience, that has helped me realise my life long dream.</p>
